## Counter Project

### Initial Setup 

1. Button for increase, decrease, and reset (val to 0)
2. CSS styling

----

### Final Setup 

1. Looping through each button classes and adding eventlistener 
2. If the class contains (decrease / increase / reset) => perform that operation 
3. Numbers are displayed as green, red, black (based on value)

----

### Notes:

1. NodeList - similar to arrays but doesn't have all the functions
2. callback function -> call a function after an event takes place
    For eg; `addEventListener`, `setTimeout`

    ```
    Can be synchronous or asynchronous 
    Synchronous: Eg; ForEach 
    Callback functions inside foreach iterates through each element one by one (generally).
    Asynchronous: Eg; setTimeout() 
    calls a function after a specific time
    ```
